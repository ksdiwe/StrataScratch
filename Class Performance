Class Performance
You are given a table containing assignment scores of students in a class. Write a query that identifies the largest difference in total score  of all assignments.
Output just the difference in total score (sum of all 3 assignments) between a student with the highest score and a student with the lowest score.

> Python Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

box_scores['highest_score'] = box_scores['assignment1'] + box_scores['assignment2'] + box_scores['assignment3']
difference = box_scores['highest_score'].max() - box_scores['highest_score'].min()
difference
