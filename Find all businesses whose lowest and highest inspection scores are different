Find all businesses whose lowest and highest inspection scores are different

Find all businesses whose lowest and highest inspection scores are different.
Output the corresponding business name and the lowest and highest scores of each business. HINT: you can assume there are no different businesses that share the same business name
Order the result based on the business name in ascending order.

> Python:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

ins_score = sf_restaurant_health_violations.groupby(['business_name'])['inspection_score'].agg(min_score = 'min', max_score = 'max').reset_index()
ins_score = ins_score.rename(columns={"": "business_name"})
result = ins_score[ins_score['min_score'] != ins_score['max_score']].sort_values('business_name')
result.dropna()
