Differences In Movie Ratings
Calculate the average lifetime rating and rating from the movie with second biggest id across all actors and all films they had acted in. Remove null ratings from the calculation.
Role type is "Normal Acting". Output a list of actors, their average lifetime rating, rating from the film with the second biggest id (use id column), and the absolute difference between the two ratings.

>Python Code:
SELECT sq1.name,
       sq1.second_last_rating,
       lifetime_rating,
       ABS(second_last_rating - lifetime_rating) AS variance
FROM
  (SELECT name,
          rating AS second_last_rating,
          row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY name
                             ORDER BY id DESC) AS rk
   FROM nominee_filmography
   WHERE rating IS NOT NULL AND role_type = 'Normal Acting'
   GROUP BY name,
            rating,
            id) sq1
JOIN
  (SELECT name,
          avg(rating) AS lifetime_rating
   FROM nominee_filmography
   WHERE role_type = 'Normal Acting'
   GROUP BY name) sq2 ON sq1.name = sq2.name
WHERE rk = 2
