ON t1.region = t2.region AND t1.expensive_rank = t2.cheapest_rank
WHERE t1.expensive_rank = 1 and t2.cheapest_rank = 1;




-- Note: The self-join on ranked_cte is used to bring together the variety with the highest price and the variety with the lowest price for each region into one row. Hereâ€™s how this works:
-- t1 refers to the subquery instance for the most expensive variety.
-- t2 refers to the subquery instance for the cheapest variety.
-- The join condition ON t1.region = t2.region AND t1.expensive_rank = t2.cheapest_rank ensures that we are matching the region and rank properly.
