# Most Expensive And Cheapest Wine With Ties

Find the cheapest and the most expensive variety in each region. Output the region along with the corresponding most expensive and the cheapest variety. Be aware that there are 2 region columns, the price from that row applies to both of them.


Note: The results set contains ties, so your solution should account for this.


For example in the event of a tie for the cheapest wine your output should look similar to this:


* region      | most_expensive_variety        | cheapest_variety
* region_name | expensive_variety             | cheap_variety_1
* region_name | expensive_variety             | cheap_variety_2
